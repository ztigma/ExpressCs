Server management for C# inspired by nodejs + Express.

This is a technology that i created, inspiring in the management of servers such as Express from NodeJs,

For now it only has the POST and GET methods, it works in a very similar way to Express, for now it seems to behave Synchronously, it would be good if it does it Asynchronously.

It has a View Manager called "View"

Express C# it's fun.
